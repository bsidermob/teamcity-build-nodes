This is a Packer template which creates an AWS AMI image which is used by TeamCity build nodes.

As there's lots of Windows features in it, it is very time consuming to rebuild everything from scratch upon a minor change, hence 
it's split up in 3 images (layers):

1. Base-IIS-Windows
2. Base-BuildAgent
3. BuildAgent
