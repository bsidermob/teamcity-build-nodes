This is a terraform template used by TeamCity job 'SpinUpDevVM'.

It's a launch configuration with settings which are used to spin up those VMs.
Make sure you destroy the configuration first using
terraform destoy

As otherwise, the default version would point to the previous version
Then run
terraform apply

or run ./Launch-Template/execute.sh from the parent folder
