This VM is intended for dev usage. Upon spin up, Octopus deploys
the current Development and Testing release to it. You can see the release
numbers in Octopus Deploy Web UI. Octopus service stops after 20 minutes so new
deploys won't be happening unless you run manually "Octopus_Start"
link on desktop.

This VM has exactly the same configuration as our TeamCity build nodes. If
something builds there - it'll build here and vice versa.

Please shutdown the VM when you're finished. It'll be deleted automatically upon
shutdown so if you'd need a new one, spin up a new one. Please be mindful
as we're trying to save up on AWS costs.

Enjoy.
